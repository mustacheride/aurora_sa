			<p>No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop,  since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.</p>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Perception, Stealth</li>
				<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Thieves’ tools.</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A scimitar, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Pirates might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.</p>
