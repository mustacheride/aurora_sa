			<p>Your body has become that of an Ooze. You gain various abilities based on the type of ooze you choose. You no longer need to sleep or breathe, but you still must eat. That said as an Ooze you can eat a lot of things. At 1st level you become an Ooze choosing your Ooze type which grants you special abilities and features. You gain more abilities from your choice at later levels. You also become Resistant to Acid and Immune to Prone. You become immune to Acid at 10th level. You gain further Oozey Abilities based on your ooze type at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 15th and 17th levels. For most oozes you are not going to be able to wear or wield most gear or magic items. However you can temporarily consume a magic item.  When you do so the magic item seems to melt into your body, subsumed by your ooze and becoming a part of you.  For the duration you gain the effects of the magic item.  If the item requires attunement you must attune to it as part of this process.  The item becomes inaccessible to anyone else until you spend some time regurgitating, or reconstituting the item.</p>
